Education
------
B.S. in Computer Science(Network Engineering), Jinan University, 2019

M.S. in Data Analytics and Statistics & Information Systems Management, Washington University in Saint Louis, 2021

Ph.D in Statistic, University of South Carolina, 2021-present

Research Interest
------
My research focuses on biostatistics and genetics, where I develop and apply statistical methods to analyze gene pair co-expression patterns across cell temporal trajectory and spatial scales. My work utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data to track how gene pair relationships shift as cells progress through developmental stages. A significant aspect of my work involves addressing the challenges of analyzing scRNAseq data, including its zero-inflated nature and over-dispersion, to ensure accurate modeling of complex gene regulations.
